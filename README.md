# RATE MY TA CS188 PROJECT

To get started, please follow these instructions. I highly recommend using a virtual environment you can find the documentation to do that here:

https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

This project is set up using python 3.

- Install all  the dependencies into your virtual environment
- Then launch the server

```sh
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 app.py
```

Every time you come to the project you only need to launch the server
```sh
$ python3 app.py
```
